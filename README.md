# 🎉 **Banking System Project** 🎉

## 📝 **Project Description**
Welcome to the **Banking System Project**! 🏦 This application simulates a simple banking system where customers can open checking and savings accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and even transfer money between accounts. Plus, there's built-in **overdraft protection** that ensures no one goes beyond their limits! 😉

## 💻 **Technologies Used**
Here's what makes this project tick:

- **Python** 🐍 – for all the backend magic!
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – to make sure our banking system is as organized as your finances.
- **CSV File Handling** – for storing customer and account data.
- **Basic Authentication** – to secure user login.

## 🚀 **Icebox Features** ❄️
These are features we *could* add to make this project even more amazing:

- **Online Bill Payments** 💳 – Allow users to pay bills directly from their account.
- **Loan System** 🏠 – Let customers apply for loans and track payments.
- **Interest Rates** 💰 – Add an interest rate for savings accounts and compound the interest over time.
- **Admin Panel** 🛠️ – An admin dashboard to view and manage all customer accounts.
- **SMS/Email Notifications** 📱 – Notify customers when transactions are made or when their balance is low.

## 🚧 **Challenges / Key Takeaways From Experience**
Here are the juicy bits we learned while working on this project:

- **Handling Overdraft Protection**: Implementing the logic to handle overdrafts and ensuring no account exceeds the $100 overdraft limit was tricky, but a lot of fun! 🎢
- **Authentication Management**: Adding a login system required some extra work to manage customer sessions, making sure only authorized users could perform transactions. 🔐
- **Complexity of Real-life Banking Logic**: Simulating the complexities of a real-world banking system (like overdraft protection and multiple account types) taught me a lot about designing financial applications. 💡
- **Account Deactivation**: Ensuring accounts get properly deactivated after two overdrafts and only reactivated once the user has paid their fees was a challenge, but we got there! 🔄

## 🎨 **Conclusion**
This project was a ton of fun and a great learning experience! 🎉 From handling customer data to implementing advanced banking features like overdraft protection, I’m proud of how this system turned out. I hope you enjoyed checking it out as much as I enjoyed building it! 😄

Now, let’s make sure everyone keeps their accounts in the green! 💸
